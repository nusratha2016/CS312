NEW YORK—Not long ago, I ran into an acquaintance who was defensive about still carrying a BlackBerry.
He didn’t have to be. Though their ranks are small, BlackBerry loyalists are an ardent bunch, folks who
appreciate all that the once dominant smartphone maker delivered in its heyday, handsets with first-rate
physical keyboards, industrial strength security, generous batteries. BlackBerry —  the Waterloo, Canada,
company — has stopped making the hardware. But now there’s a new BlackBerry I’ve been reviewing called KeyOne,
the first from China’s TCL Communication under a brand licensing agreement with BlackBerry. The $549 phone was
formally introduced in February during the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, and is finally slated
to arrive in the U.S. and elsewhere at the end of this month. I’m confident the BlackBerry fan I ran into will
love it. Put me down as liking the phone too, though not to the degree that I’d be willing to swap the best phones
on the market today, Apple’s iPhone 7 or Samsung’s Galaxy S8. A workaholic phone: The KeyOne is an impressive
throwback that measures up to vintage BlackBerry strengths, only in a more modern package that uses the Android
Nougat operating system, with such up-to-date features as the Google Assistant. The 6.35-ounce device is built
of sturdy anodized aluminum and has an easy to grip rubbery back with tiny dimples. It stands roughly as tall
as the iPhone 7 Plus. The (1620x1080) screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 — nice, but at 4.5-inches, on the
small side. And its rather unusual 3:2 aspect ratio means the display is better suited for reading emails than
for watching Guardians of the Galaxy, though you certainly could. But there’s no mistaking the fact that
BlackBerry’s have corporate rather than cinematic roots. The 12-megapixel front and 8-megapixel rear cameras
on the KeyOne are perfectly fine but I wouldn’t call them exceptional. And good as the backlit physical
keyboard is, after a near decade of composing texts and emails on virtual touchscreen keyboards, I found
typing on the BlackBerry comparatively slower and frankly a bit of a chore given its squishy-sized keys.
I suspect those of you who’ve stuck with BlackBerry all these years will see it differently. Vintage
features with new tricks: The BlackBerry crowd will recognize other helpful staples, including the
convenient BlackBerry Hub repository for emails, messages, tweets and other communications,
BlackBerry’s DTEK security software for safeguarding the operating system and your data,
and the presence of BlackBerry Messenger.
